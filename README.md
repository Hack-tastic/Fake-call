### Project Description
A fake call app allows users to simulate incoming phone calls, providing a realistic caller ID, ringtone, and interface. It's often used for pranks or as a quick escape from awkward situations.

### The Problem statement
People need a quick and discreet way to escape awkward or uncomfortable situations, but lack a reliable tool to simulate realistic incoming calls.

### The Solution
The solution is a fake call app that allows users to schedule or instantly trigger realistic incoming calls with customizable caller details, ringtones, and interfaces, providing a quick and believable way to exit uncomfortable situations.

User Input: The user enters a fake caller's name, sets a time delay for the call, and uploads a custom ringtone.
Scheduling: When the user clicks "Schedule Fake Call," the app stores the inputs and waits for the specified delay.
Simulated Call: After the delay, the app displays an incoming call screen with the caller's name and plays the selected ringtone.
